# Shoelala

_Good things come in pairs_

"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house" - Michael Scott

# Checkout
Since this is not an actual online store, but rather a mockup, please do not enter any legitimate data such as your credit/debit card number, when checking out. Other than that, have fun! 


# Process
We used continuous integration (Travis CI) and Heroku to deploy our website. On the back-end, we used Express as the server, and PostgreSQL as the database. On the front-end, we used React, Redux, React-Redux and Stripe for the checkout page.
